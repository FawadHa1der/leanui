# LeanUI performance

LeanUI is measured with the [js-framework-benchmark](https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark)
keyed operations, against a hand-written vanilla JavaScript implementation, in Chromium (with
traces), in release Chrome and Firefox, and natively. This page gives the results, the method,
and what was learned getting there.

All numbers: Apple-silicon Mac (10 performance and 4 efficiency cores), macOS 26, headless
browsers, medians. Each browser measurement loads a fresh page, does the operation's warm-up clicks,
and times one click.

<!-- RESULTS -->

## Method

**The apps.** [`examples/Bench.lean`](../examples/Bench.lean) is the standard benchmark app: the same
buttons, ids, table structure and class names, keyed rows (`keyed` + `lazy` on id, label and
selection), and labels from a 64-bit LCG instead of `Math.random`.
[`bench/vanilla/index.html`](../bench/vanilla/index.html) is the reference: template cloning,
direct node references and event delegation, the usual fastest hand-written approach, with the
same markup and the same LCG, so **both build identical tables** (the harness checks this before
measuring). Both pages load the same stylesheet, [`bench/bench.css`](../bench/bench.css), a small
stand-in for the Bootstrap rules the original benchmark uses, so layout and paint work is identical.

**Operations** ([`bench/ops.mjs`](../bench/ops.mjs)): create 1,000 rows; replace them; update every
10th row; select a row; swap rows 2 and 999; remove a row; create 10,000 rows; append 1,000 rows to
1,000; clear 1,000 rows. Each has the original benchmark's warm-ups.

**Chromium, traced** ([`tests/browser/bench.mjs`](../tests/browser/bench.mjs), Playwright's
Chromium): each measured click is a real input event recorded with the DevTools timeline. *Script*
is the click's `EventDispatch`: for LeanUI, the Lean update, view and diff, and applying the
command buffer to the DOM. *Render* is the main-thread work of the frame that follows (style,
layout, pre-paint, paint, layerize, commit). *Total* is their sum: the CPU time the click costs,
without the wait for the next vsync, which is up to a frame of idle time for every
implementation alike. The same harness records memory after the standard sequences (JS heap after
a full GC, the wasm linear memory, DOM nodes) and startup (navigation to first render, bytes
transferred).

**Release browsers, self-driven** ([`bench/runner.html`](../bench/runner.html),
[`tests/browser/selfbench.mjs`](../tests/browser/selfbench.mjs)): the installed browser is launched
directly on a throwaway profile with no automation protocol attached; the page loads each
implementation in an iframe, performs the operations itself and posts the results back. *Script*
is the synchronous click; *layout* adds a forced layout (no paint). Chrome reports
`performance.now()` in 0.1 ms steps without cross-origin isolation, so its smallest numbers are
coarse.

**Native** ([`tests/Perf.lean`](../tests/Perf.lean), `leanui-perf`): the Lean side alone (update,
view, diff, command encoding, no DOM), on the same app, with lazy rows and with eager rows.

## Reproducing

```bash
tools/build-app.sh BenchApp bench                       # dist/bench (the page is examples/bench.html)
node tests/browser/bench.mjs --runs 7 --json out.json   # Chromium traces, memory, startup
node tests/browser/selfbench.mjs /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox firefox
node tests/browser/selfbench.mjs "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" chromium
./.lake/build/bin/leanui-perf                           # native, lazy and eager rows
LEANUI_PAGE=examples/bench.html tools/build-app.sh BenchApp bench-prof --debug
node tests/browser/profile.mjs dist/bench-prof --op create1k   # where the script time goes
bench/wasm64/build.sh && node tests/browser/wasm64.mjs <browser-binary> <firefox|chromium>
```

Run browser measurements one at a time on an otherwise idle machine.
